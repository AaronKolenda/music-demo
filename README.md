# Drum Chum

Drum Chum was my final project for the Iron Yard. It is a drum machine I built with Javascript and Backbone.js, with a simple Node.js back end. The user can create and save a new drum beat, or edit an already existing beat or demo beat. Each beat is saved by creating a uniquely generated url to access it.
